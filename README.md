## About
A .NET desktop application that uses Google Maps Distance Matrix API and Google Places API to aid in selecting a restaurant to eat at. The UI displays results from search queries in an ordered table allowing for users to organize their query results. The built-in browser (Chromium using CefSharp) can be used by double clicking either the address or the name of restaurant query results for easy access to directions and other related searches to the selected restaurant.
